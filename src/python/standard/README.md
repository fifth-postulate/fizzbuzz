# FizzBuzz in python
This is a straight forward python implementation of FizzBuzz

## Development
Make sure to create an venv directory with the following command

```plain
python3 -m venv .venv
```

And source the correct file for your environment. E.g.

```plain
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`main.py` is a selfcontained python program that tests the FizzBuzz
implementation. If you want to develop you can execute `tdd`. This is a fish
shell script that wathes the `main.py` and on writes runs it.
